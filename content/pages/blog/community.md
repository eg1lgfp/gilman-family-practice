Osteopathic medicine is based on the idea that all the body’s systems are 
interrelated. Osteopaths focus on treating the whole person. There are 
more than 114,000 DOs in the U.S. And more than 1 in 4 U.S. medical 
students are on the path to becoming a doctor of osteopathic medicine 
(DO). 

Osteopathic medicine dates back more than 100 years. Its founder, Andrew Taylor 
Still, thought that correcting problems with the body's structure could 
help the body heal itself. Still, who practiced during the Civil War, 
believed that spine problems can send nerve signals out to all the 
organs and make you sick. He developed osteopathic manipulation 
treatments  with a goal of restoring the nerves to a healthy state and 
promoting circulation so the body could heal itself.

One key idea in this field is that many diseases result from, or cause, 
problems within the body's musculoskeletal system, which includes 
nerves, muscles, and bones. DOs pay extra attention to how all your body
 parts work together in order to prevent or treat health issues. And 
they get special training in that.

Osteopathic
medicine is about your whole body, not just specific parts or symptoms.
 So if you come in with, say, knee pain, they’re likely going to look at
 more than your knee.

Osteopathic
 doctors believe touch can be healing. All DOs are trained in 
osteopathic manipulative treatment, sometimes called manual manipulation
 or OMT. That's a hands-on method to help diagnose and treat illnesses. 
Not all DOs use it regularly in their practice, though.
