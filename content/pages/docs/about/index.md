Whether you are a new patient or there are changes in your insurance or contact information, please complete the Patient Information form and the Medication information form as accurately as possible. Bring the forms and your insurance card on your next visit.

> *We recommend that you arrive 15 minutes prior to your scheduled appointment. And, then call the office and wait for someone will let you inside. This allows ample time for you to be registered and complete any needed forms. (this is a COVID-19 measure that is subject to change as new guidance is received).*

#### Friendly Reminders:

**➡️  Don't forget to bring your insurance card with you**

**➡️  Please be ready to make your co-pay during your visit**

**➡️  Bring an up to date list of all your medications or your prescription bottles with you**. ***Let's go to Medications List >>***
